### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Oche Emmanuel Ike, I am a Computer engineer, with a massive interest in building scalable web tools and applications and my experiences spans Fullstack Web Development, Devops,  Blockchain and CrossPlatform mobile applications development .

I am passionate about diving deep into people's painpoints and converting everyday challenges in functional and interactive products that help make people (and businesses) live better and more prosperous lives.

I am also an embedded systems enthusiast. In my free time I love diving deep into low level systems, playing the piano, making illustrations and watching Anime (heavy attack on titan fan here ;-)
